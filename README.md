This document is very WIP at the moment but for right now, here's the status. Since I've had a couple people asking to contribute code (no you're breathtaking!) I wanted to put some basic guidelines out there. I'm looking at using the Gitflow model (or at least a simplified version of it... read more here: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow

BRANCHES
Main - for major releases (production)
Develop - in progress features
Feature-FEATURENAME - I'm asking that folks who would like to contribute create a feature branch off Develop and then submit a Pull Request when that feature is ready. 

Of course, if you just want to fork the project for yourself, by all means have at it :)

Turth be told, I wasn't expecting folks to want to contribute to this project at all, certainly no so quickly. So I'm in the process of scrambling to give this project the strucutre and guidelines contributors (and users deserve).

For those who arrived here through my YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNqFLmbWW-Y) the plan hasn't changed. I'll still be holding new features in batches and pushing them along with a video explaining the additions, followed by a small game made with the latest version of this template. The only difference is that those vidoes may now include code from the community which comes with some (very welcomed) overhead.

Special thanks to Fritzy and Braydee (of GameDev Artisan: https://www.youtube.com/@GameDevArtisan) who have both been very generous with their time advising me on best practices for this setup. And many thanks to you for your patience while I take a slight detour to the land of open source project management. <3
